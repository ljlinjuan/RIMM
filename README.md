# RIMM
This is a project for MFE programming courses. RIMM is an interesting idea so i tried to implement it with python code.

It is just a simple practice, lots of improvement can be done.

Only report and datafeed files uploaded. Other codes needed in backtesting are not uploaded.

How the image is displayed needs to be improved.
